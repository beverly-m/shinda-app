# Shinda - A Financial Management Application for Small Business

Shinda is a Flutter application built to improve financial management among small businesses. SME's are essential for our communities as they contribute immensely to the economy through aspects such as job creation. Therefore, it is essential that small business owners have adequate tools to maintain business profitability and sustainability. I hope this application will be a valuable contribution to this cause.

## Application Tests
Other than manual tests, unit and widget tests have been conducted to ensure the application's reliability and accuracy.
